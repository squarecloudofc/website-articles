[Client]: ./#client

```python
import squarecloud as square

client = square.Client(api_key='API_KEY')

async def example():
    app_status = await client.app_status('application_id')
    print(app_status)
```

## Parameters:

* api\_key

`api_key: str`: This is the required parameter when instantiating the Client object.
A valid API key must be provided as a string for authentication to be performed correctly.

* debug

`debug: bool = True`: This is an optional parameter that controls the debug mode of
the Client object. When set to True, every time a request is made, the Client object prints
debug information to facilitate the detection and resolution of
issues. However, in production environments, it is common to set this parameter
to False to avoid displaying unnecessary information.
This value defaults to True.

## Application

Using the [Client], you can obtain an object (or a list of
objects) that represents your application. This object would be an instance of the
Application class that you can use
to manage your application more conveniently, without always needing to pass
the id of your application.
