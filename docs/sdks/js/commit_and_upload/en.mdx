    ```javascript
    const { SquareCloudAPI } = require("@squarecloud/api");
    const api = new SquareCloudAPI("Your API Key");

    const application = await api.applications.get("Application ID");

    // Specify the content and name of the file you want to commit
    const fileContent = Buffer.from("Your file content");
    const fileName = "file.txt";

    // Perform the commit operation
    const success = await application.commit(fileContent, fileName);

    // Handle the result accordingly
    if (success) {
        console.log(`File "${fileName}" committed successfully.`);
    } else {
        console.error(`Failed to commit file "${fileName}".`);
    }
    ```

  <Tab title="Using Absolute Path">
    ```javascript
    const { SquareCloudAPI } = require("@squarecloud/api");
    const api = new SquareCloudAPI("Your API Key");

    const application = await api.applications.get("Application ID");

    // Specify the content and name of the file you want to commit
    const { join } = require("node:path");
    const fileName = "file.txt";
    const filePath = join(__dirname, fileName);

    // Optionally, set whether the application should restart after the commit
    const shouldRestart = true;

    // Perform the commit operation
    const success = await application.commit(filePath, fileName, shouldRestart);

    // Handle the result accordingly
    if (success) {
        console.log(`File "${fileName}" committed successfully.`);
    } else {
        console.error(`Failed to commit file "${fileName}".`);
    }
    ```

## Making a upload

`application.create()` is a method that allows you to upload a application to Square Cloud.

```javascript
const { SquareCloudAPI } = require("@squarecloud/api");
const api = new SquareCloudAPI("Your API Key");

// Specify the content and name of the zip file you want to upload
const { join } = require("node:path");
const fileName = "application.zip";
const filePath = join(__dirname, fileName);

// Perform the upload operation
const success = await api.applications.create(filePath);

// Handle the result accordingly
if (success) {
    console.log(`Application uploaded successfully.`, success);
    // Return the application uploaded information (id, tag, description, etc.)
} else {
    console.error(`Failed to upload application.`);
}
```

**Remember that to upload an application you need a zip that contains (at least) the following files:**:

* Main file: responsible for starting your application
* Dependencies file: contains information about which dependencies are necessary
* Configuration file (squarecloud.app): a configuration file specifying the
  name,
  description, main file name, version, etc. To learn more about the
  configuration file, take a look at this [guide](https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file).
