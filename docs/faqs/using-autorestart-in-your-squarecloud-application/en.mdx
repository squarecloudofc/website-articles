A **Square Cloud exclusive technology**, Auto Restart is a powerful feature in Square Cloud that allows your application to **automatically restart in case it crashes**. This ensures that **your app** remains **accessible and functional** even in the **event of unexpected failures**.

## Enabling Auto Restart

With Auto Restart, follow these steps to enable it in your application's configuration file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Config file">
    Create or edit your `squarecloud.app` or `squarecloud.config` file.

    <Card title="How to create a configuration file" href="/getting-started/config-file">
      The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate parameter">
    Locate the `AUTORESTART` parameter in the configuration file. Or add it if it doesn't exist.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set value">
    Set the value of `AUTORESTART` to `true`.

    Here's an example of how to enable Auto Restart in your configuration file:

    ```systemd squarecloud.app OR squarecloud.config
    AUTORESTART=true
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Auto Restart Works

Auto Restart is a proactive feature that monitors the health of your application. If your application crashes or becomes unresponsive, Auto Restart takes action to get it back up and running.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Application goes down">
    When your application crashes or becomes unresponsive, Auto Restart detects the issue if AUTORESTART is enabled in your configuration file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Application Uptime Verification">
    If the **application uptime is > 60 seconds**, will proceed to next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Application Exit Status Verification">
    If the **application exit status is 1**, will proceed to next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Application Recent Restart Verification">
    If the **application didn't restart in the last 60 minutes**, will proceed to next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Application Exception Verification">
    If the application logs contain any of the excluded errors, Auto Restart will not restart the application.

    Examples of excluded errors include:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json SyntaxError
      SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'X'..
      SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'X'..
      SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token 'X'..
      ```

      ```json Version didn't find
      npm ERR! notarget No matching version found for
      ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
      And variations of this error.
      ```

      ```json Module not found
      Error: Cannot find module 'X'
      Module not found: Can't resolve 'X' in 'Y'
      And variations of this error.
      ```

      ```json Invalid dependency file
      ERROR: Invalid requirement: 'X'
      ERROR: Could not open requirements file: 'X'
      npm ERR! code EJSONPARSE... npm ERR! Failed to parse json
      And variations of this error.
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    If the application logs contain any of these errors, Auto Restart will not restart the application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Application Restart">
    AUTORESTART automatically restarts your application to bring it back. ðŸ˜‰
    <Info>Cooldown between restarts is 60 minutes.</Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to make the most of Auto Restart:

- Regularly review your application's logs to understand the reasons for any crashes or restarts. This can help you identify and address underlying issues.
- Keep your MAIN file and memory allocation parameters up-to-date to ensure optimal performance and resource usage.

## Conclusion

Auto Restart in Square Cloud is a valuable feature that enhances the reliability of your application. By automatically handling crashes and unresponsiveness, it helps maintain a seamless user experience. Ensure that you have a plan with Auto Restart enabled and configure it in your `squarecloud.app` or `squarecloud.config` file to make the most of this feature.
