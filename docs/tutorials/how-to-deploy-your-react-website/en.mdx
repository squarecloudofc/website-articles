## Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [sign up page](https://squarecloud.app/signup). You can use your email to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

### Creating a React Project

To create a new React project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

In the above command, `my-react-app` is the name of your new project. You can replace `my-react-app` with any desired name for your project.

`create-react-app` is a package available in the npm registry that sets up a new React project for you. It takes care of all the initial setup, such as creating the project directory, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring basic files.

## Configuring the Production Environment with Serve

After having your React project created and configured, it's time to prepare it for production. For this, we will use a library called `serve`. This library is a static server that can serve your React project after it has been built.

### Installing the Serve Library

To install the `serve` library, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install serve@14.2.3
```

This command installs version `14.2.3` of the `serve` library. If you want to install the latest version, you can omit the `@14.2.3`.

### Configuring the Startup Script

After installing the `serve` library, you need to configure your project's startup script to use `serve`. To do this, open your project's `package.json` file and add a new script called `start:prod`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "start:prod": "serve -s build -l 80",
  ...
}
```

In the `start:prod` script, `serve -s build -l 80` does the following:
- `serve`: This is the command to start the `serve` server.
- `-s build`: The `-s` option serves the `build` directory in single-page application mode. This means all not-found requests will be redirected to `index.html`. The `build` directory is created when you run `npm run build`.
- `-l 80`: The `-l` option followed by `80` tells `serve` to listen on port 80. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic.

Now, when you want to start your project in production mode, you can run the `npm run start:prod` command. This command first builds your React project and then serves the built files using `serve` on port 80.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the `START` field is essential for customizing the startup command. If you want to build and start your application on Square Cloud, configure the `START` field as follows:

```app squarecloud.app
START=npm run build && npm run start:prod
```

This command will execute the "build" and "start:prod" scripts defined in your `package.json`:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "serve": "^14.2.3",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "start:prod": "serve -s build -l 80",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```
## Purchasing a Plan Before Uploading Your Project

Before you can upload your project to Square Cloud, it's important to understand that you need to purchase a plan. The type of plan you choose will depend on the resources required by your application. You can view our plans here.

<Note>**Are you wondering how much RAM and CPU your plan needs to host a React website?** Don't worry, we're here to help. React is a JavaScript framework known for its speed and flexibility. It allows developers to build large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. It's also relatively easy to learn, making it accessible for beginners. Our **[Standard](https://squarecloud.app/pay/standard)** plan offers **4GB** of RAM and **4vCPU**, which should be sufficient for most React websites. However, if you're working on a larger project or need more stability, we recommend considering our Pro plan. With additional resources, you can ensure smooth performance even under high demand. To purchase, simply click [here](https://squarecloud.app/pay/pro).</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/uploading.gif" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:
        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```
        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file: 
        ```bash 
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your application hosted on Square Cloud, note that, by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mysite.com.br`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to set up your custom domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirement" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website is 512MB, however, when building your site directly on Square, it is advisable to use a higher amount, or you may encounter the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary access Denied" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
