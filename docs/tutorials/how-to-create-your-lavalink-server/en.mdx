## Creating the application.yml

Create a configuration file for your Lavalink server. You can access an example file [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example).

<Warning>Set the `port` field in your `application.yml` file to: `80`.</Warning>

## Enhancing Security

It is highly recommended to configure a secure password in the `password` field of your configuration file (application.yml). We recommend using a password with at least 32 characters.

<Note>It is important to remember that you must use port 443 (SSL) and the `secure` option in `true` to connect to your lavalink.</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

Create a compressed file (.zip) containing the `Lavalink.jar` and `application.yml`. Then, upload your configuration file to Square Cloud.
