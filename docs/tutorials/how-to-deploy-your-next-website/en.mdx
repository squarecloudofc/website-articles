## Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [sign up page](https://squarecloud.app/signup). You can use your email to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

### Creating a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

In this command, `my-app` is the name of your new project. You can replace `my-app` with any name you want for your project. The `npx` command is a tool that comes with `npm`, the Node.js package manager. It is used to run Node.js packages that are installed locally in your project or are available remotely on the npm registry.

`create-next-app` is a package available on the npm registry that sets up a new Next.js project for you. It takes care of all the initial setup, such as creating the project directory, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring basic files.

`@latest` is a tag specifying that you want to use the latest version of the `create-next-app` package. This ensures you're always using the most updated version and, consequently, have access to the latest features.

## Configuring Port 80

Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic. To host a Next.js website on Square Cloud, it's crucial to configure the use of port 80. In Next.js, you can set the `-p 80` parameter in the startup script to ensure your website runs correctly on this port.

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the `START` field is essential for customizing the startup command. If you want to build and start your website on Square Cloud, configure the `START` field as follows:

```app squarecloud.app
START=npm run build && npm run start
```

This command will execute the "build" and "start" scripts defined in your `package.json`:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start -p 80",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18",
    "next": "14.1.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.0.1",
    "postcss": "^8",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Purchasing a Plan Before Uploading Your Project

Before you can upload your project to Square Cloud, it's important to understand that you need to purchase a plan. The type of plan you choose will depend on the resources required by your application. You can view our plans [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

<Note>**Are you wondering how much RAM and CPU your plan needs to host a Next.js website?** Don't worry, we're here to help. Next.js is a React framework best known for its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities. It's designed to provide an optimal developer experience through features like zero-config, automatic TypeScript support, file-system based routing, and built-in CSS support. Our **[Standard](https://squarecloud.app/pay/standard)** plan offers **4GB** of RAM and **4vCPU**, which should be sufficient for most Next.js websites. However, if you're working on a larger project or need more stability, we recommend considering our Pro plan. With additional resources, you can ensure smooth performance even under high demand. To purchase, simply click [here](https://squarecloud.app/pay/pro).</Note>

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.

    </Frame>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```

        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>

          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command:

        ```bash
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file:

        ```bash
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain" icon="globe" iconType="solid">
    If you want to use a custom domain for your website hosted on Square Cloud, note that, by default, the URL will be something like `https://mysite.squareweb.app/`. The subdomain is determined by the SUBDOMAIN field in the configuration file. However, if you prefer to use a custom domain, such as `mysite.com.br`, you'll need to purchase the `Standard` plan or a higher plan. We detail each step to set up your custom domain in our article: [How to set up your custom domain](https://docs.squarecloud.app/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-domain).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum RAM Requirement" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    The minimum amount of RAM required to host a website is 512MB, however, when building your site directly on Square, it is advisable to use a higher amount, or you may encounter the [LACK\_OF\_RAM](https://docs.squarecloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary access Denied" icon="ban" iconType="solid">
    If you receive the message "Your access has been temporarily denied." after trying to access the site, please wait for some time. If the issue persists, feel free to contact us at https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/support.
