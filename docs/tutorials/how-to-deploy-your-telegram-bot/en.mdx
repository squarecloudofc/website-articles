## Introduction

- Before you start coding, you need to set up your bot properly on Telegram. First, it's necessary to have a Telegram account. If you don't have one yet, you can create one by visiting the [official Telegram website](https://telegram.org/).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting Started" icon="rocket" iconType="solid">
    First, you should access [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/a/) and search for a bot called "BotFather."

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting the Token" icon="key" iconType="solid">
    Click on it to start a conversation and type "start." When it sends the message, choose the "/newbot" option. After that, it will ask for the name you want for your bot, and finally, when you choose the name, it will generate the token.

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>Remember to keep your bot's token secret as it can be used to control your bot.</Warning>

- Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [sign up page](https://squarecloud.app/signup). You can use your email to create an account.
- Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

# Using wrappers for bot creation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="node-telegram-bot-api">
    1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
    2. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`. This will create a new `package.json` file for your project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

    3. Install the node-telegram-bot-api library using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install node-telegram-bot-api
    ```

    4. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) and add the following code to create a basic Discord bot:

    ```javascript index.js
    // Importing the node-telegram-bot-api library
    const TelegramBot = require("node-telegram-bot-api");

    // Configuring the API key
    const token = "your token here";

    // Initializing the bot
    const bot = new TelegramBot(token, { polling: true });

    // Getting bot information
    bot.getMe().then((botInfo) => {
      // Getting the bot's name
      const botName = botInfo.username;

      // Defining a route for messages that are not commands
      bot.on("message", (msg) => {
        // Getting the chat ID
        const chatId = msg.chat.id;
        // Getting the user's message
        const userMsg = msg.text;
        // Formatting the message to be sent
        const responseMsg = `${botName} Says: ${userMsg}`;
        // Sending the message
        bot.sendMessage(chatId, responseMsg);
      });

      // Printing the bot's name
      console.log(botName);
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="telebot">
    1. Ensure you have Python and Pip (a package manager for Python) installed on your system. If not, you can download them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and the [official Pip website](https://pypi.org/).
    2. Install the telebot library using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install telebot
    ```

    3. Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and add the following code to create a basic Telegram bot:

    ```python main.py
    # Importing the telebot_router library
    from telebot_router import TeleBot

    # Initializing the bot
    app = TeleBot(__name__)

    # Defining a route for messages that are not commands
    @app.route('(?!/).+')
    def parrot(message):
        # Getting the chat ID
        chat_dest = message['chat']['id']
        # Getting the user's message
        user_msg = message['text']
        # Getting bot information
        bot_info = app.get_me()['result']
        # Getting the bot's name
        bot_name = bot_info['username']
        # Formatting the message to be sent
        msg = "{} Says: {}".format(bot_name, user_msg)
        # Sending the message
        app.send_message(chat_dest, msg)
        
    # Defining the main function
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Configuring the API key
        app.config['api_key'] = 'your token here'
        # Getting bot information
        bot_info = app.get_me()['result']
        # Getting the bot's name
        bot_name = bot_info['username']
        # Printing the bot's name
        print(f"{bot_name}") 
        # Starting the bot
        app.poll(debug=True)
    ```

    4. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all external libraries needed for your project:

    ```txt requirements.txt
    telebot
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## Configuring the START Field

<Warning>Only use this field if you are really sure about what you are doing.</Warning>

In the Square Cloud configuration file, the **START** field is optional and only needed if you are using a custom script to start the bot. In the provided example, the **START** field is not necessary.

## Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/uploading.gif" style={{ borderRadius: "0.2rem" }} />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```

        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>

          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command:

        ```bash
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file:

        ```bash
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing the Bot

If you have done everything correctly, simply search for your bot on Telegram and send a message; it will echo it back to you.
