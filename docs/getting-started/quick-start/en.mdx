    After accessing the dashboard, you need to create a configuration file. You can create a [configuration file](/getting-started/config-file) reading this article [here](/getting-started/config-file).

    VERSION=recommended
    SUBDOMAIN=batman
    START=npm run build && npm run start
    DISPLAY_NAME=Batman website
    DESCRIPTION=This website is the dark knight of the night.
    ```
