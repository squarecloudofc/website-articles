Once you've signed up, you can start deploying your applications on Square Cloud after selected the plan that suits your needs.

## Facilitating your journey with CLI ðŸ’»

This Overview uses a [Square Cloud CLI](/cli) to deploy your applications. The CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with Square Cloud services. You can use the CLI to deploy applications, manage services, and view logs.

To use the CLI, you need to install it on your local machine. You can install the CLI using the following commands:

  <img src="https://cdn.squarecloud.app/blog/posts/changelog/01-02-2024/square-cli-install.gif" />
</Frame>
<br/>

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS, Linux, and WSL
curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
```

```bash Windows with npm
npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
```

```bash Windows with yarn
yarn global add @squarecloud/cli
```

</CodeGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the instructions about your language">
    <Snippet file="languages.mdx" />
    <Info>For this example, we will use the JavaScript (Node.js) language.</Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your Square Cloud config file">
    After installing the CLI, you need to create a configuration file. You can create a [configuration file](/getting-started/config-file) reading this article [here](/getting-started/config-file).

    My configuration file looks like this:
    ```systemd
    MAIN=index.js
    MEMORY=512
    VERSION=recommended
    DISPLAY_NAME=Robin bot
    DESCRIPTION=This bot system is designed to help you with your daily tasks.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your project">
    After this journey, you need to upload your project to Square Cloud. You can do this by running the following command:
    ```bash
    squarecloud upload
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Facilitating your journey with web interface ðŸ˜‰

If you don't like command lines or prefer to use the web interface, you can upload your project directly to the Square Cloud website. To do this, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Square Cloud website">
    Access the [Square Cloud dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard) using your account.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Create your Square Cloud config file">
    After accessing the dashboard, you need to create a configuration file. You can create a [configuration file](/getting-started/config-file) reading this article [here](/getting-started/config-file).
  </Step>
  <Step title="ZIP your project">
    After creating the configuration file, you need to zip your project.
    ```bash Using the CLI
    squarecloud zip
    ```

    Or you can zip your project manually:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Windows
      1. Locate the file or folder that you want to zip.
      2. Press and hold (or right-click) the file or folder, select (or point to) Send to, and then select Compressed (zipped) folder.
      3. A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location. To rename it, press and hold (or right-click) the folder, select Rename, and then type the new name.
      ```
      ```bash Linux
      1. Locate the file or folder that you want to zip.
      2. Right-click the file or folder, then choose Compress from the shortcut menu.
      3. A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location. To rename it, press and hold (or right-click) the folder, select Rename, and then type the new name.
      ```
      ```bash macOS
      1. Locate the file or folder that you want to zip.
      2. Control-click the file or folder, then choose Compress from the shortcut menu.
      3. A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location. To rename it, press and hold (or right-click) the folder, select Rename, and then type the new name.
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Or you can use the command line to compress your project folder:
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash macOS, Linux, and WSL
    zip -r my-project.zip .
    ```

    ```bash Windows (powershell)
    Compress-Archive -Path . -DestinationPath my-project.zip
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
   </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your project">
    After uploading your project, click on the "Add New" button to deploy your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>
