## üöÄ Introduction

* Before you begin, make sure you have PHP on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can download them from the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/).
* Next, you will need to create an account on Square Cloud, which can be done through the [login page](https://squarecloud.app/login). You can use either your email or Discord, or both, to create an account.
* Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase one according to your needs [here](https://squarecloud.app/plans).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Creating the squarecloud config file

<Card title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for Square Cloud." icon="link" href="https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file">
  The squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to
  configure your application; it will be used to define the name, description,
  version, main file, among other things.
</Card>

## üìÑ Required Files

* index.php (Example of main file).
* `composer.json` (\*Optional dependency file).
* [squarecloud.app](/getting-started/config-file) (a file containing your Square Cloud configuration).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Application

* If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, a local PHP server will be started using the `php -S 0.0.0.0:80` command. If the `START` field is defined in the configuration file, the value in the `START` field will be executed directly. For more information on configuration file parameters, visit [configuration parameters](https://docs.squarecloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).

* If the `composer.json` file exists, all dependencies will be installed using the `php composer.phar install` command.

## üñ•Ô∏è Preparing Project for Upload

Before you can host your project on Square Cloud, ensure your project files are correctly configured for hosting.

If your project includes a `composer.json` file, Square Cloud will automatically install dependencies using Composer. However, if your project also has Node dependencies (i.e., a `package.json` file), you should specify the installation process in the `START` field of your `squarecloud.app` file. For example:

```plaintext
START=npm install && php .....
```

<Warning>The configuration (`squarecloud.app/.config`) file must be located in the root of the zip file. Otherwise, Square Cloud will not be able to find it during deployment.</Warning>

## üì§ Uploading Project to Square Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to Square Cloud and host your project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Upload">
    Access the [Square Cloud
    Dashboard](https://squarecloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project
    files.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI Upload">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Step">
        First, you need to have the CLI installed in your environment. If you
        don't have it yet, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```
        npm install -g @squarecloud/cli
        ```

        If you already have it, we recommend updating it. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Windows">
            ```bash
            squarecloud update
            ```
          </Tab>

          <Tab title="Linux, macOS, and WSL">
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://cli.squarecloud.app/install | bash
            ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Second Step">
        Now, to authenticate and use other CLI commands, you will find your
        authorization key [here](https://squarecloud.app/account) by clicking on
        "Request API Key". After obtaining your authorization key, run the
        following command:

        ```bash
        squarecloud login
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Third Step">
        Finally, to deploy your application to Square Cloud using the CLI, you
        need to execute the following command, passing the path of your zip
        file:

        ```bash
        squarecloud upload zip
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
