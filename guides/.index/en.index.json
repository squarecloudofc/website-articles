You can use your email, Discord, or both to create your account.  Finally, you need to have an active paid plan on your account. You can view our plans and purchase the one that best suits your needs here.  üíª Preparing the Application  Currently, there are two ways to host websites managed by Vite: using the vite preview command or performing a local build and uploading only the static files. Both methods will be explained below.  üóëÔ∏è Unnecessary Files  Depending on the upload method, you'll have specific files to include. However, in general, the following files should never be uploaded with your application:  node\\_modules;  package-lock.json.  Upload with Local Build  This method requires first building your Vite application locally. To do this:  Open the terminal in your project root;  Run the command npm run build, which will execute the build script defined in your package.json (usually vite build);  This will generate the dist folder containing your entire site as static files.  Go into the generated dist folder and rename the HTML file to vite.html;  Compress all contents of the dist folder, including vite.html and all other files and folders.  The compression should be done in .zip format.  After completing these steps, you can upload the ZIP file, set the name, define the main file (vite.html), check the \"Publish on Web\" option, and specify the desired subdomain.  Upload with Build in the Environment  This method requires you to first modify your package.json, moving all development dependencies (devDependencies) to regular dependencies (dependencies). This is because, in production environments, development dependencies are not installed.  In your package.json, also set the \"preview\" script as vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80. This ensures that the Vite web server is accessible on all network interfaces using port 80 (HTTP), allowing routing to port 443 (HTTPS).  Compress your application, including all necessary files for execution, except the files previously mentioned as unnecessary.  During upload, select \"Publish on Web\" and enable the \"Startup Command\" option, entering the desired subdomain and the following command npm run build && npm run preview "
