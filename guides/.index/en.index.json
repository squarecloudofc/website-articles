This ensures that **your app** remains **accessible and functional** even in the **event of unexpected failures**.\n\n## Enabling Auto Restart\n\nWith Auto Restart, follow these steps to enable it in your application's configuration file:\n\n### 1. Config File\n\nCreate or edit your `squarecloud.app` or `squarecloud.config` file. See how to do it [here](...).\nThe squarecloud.app file is a configuration file that will be used to configure your application;\nit will be used to define the name, description, version, main file, among other things.\n\n### 2. Locate Parameters\n\nLocate the `AUTORESTART` parameter in the configuration file. Or add it if it doesn't exist.\n\n### 3. Set the value\n\nSet the value of `AUTORESTART` to `true`.\n\nHere's an example of how to enable Auto Restart in your configuration file:\n\n```systemd squarecloud.app OR squarecloud.config\nAUTORESTART=true\n```\n\n## How Auto Restart Works\n\nAuto Restart is a proactive feature that monitors the health of your application. If your application crashes or becomes unresponsive, Auto Restart takes action to get it back up and running.\n\n### 1. Application goes down\n\nWhen your application crashes or becomes unresponsive, Auto Restart detects the issue if AUTORESTART is enabled in your configuration file.\n\n### 2. Application Uptime Verification\n\nIf the **application uptime is > 60 seconds**, will proceed to next step.\n\n### 3. Application Exit Status Verification\n\nIf the **application exit status is 1**, will proceed to next step.\n\n### 4. Application Recent Restart Verification\">\n\nIf the **application didn't restart in the last 60 minutes**, will proceed to next step.\n\n### 5. Application Exception Verification\n\nIf the application logs contain any of the excluded errors, Auto Restart will not restart the application.\nExamples of excluded errors include:\n\n**SyntaxError**\n\n```json\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token 'X'..\nSyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'X'..\nSyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token 'X'..\n```\n\n**Version didn't find**\n\n```json\nnpm ERR! notarget No matching version found for\nERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement\nAnd variations of this error.\n```\n\n**Module not found**\n\n```json\nError: Cannot find module 'X'\nModule not found: Can't resolve 'X' in 'Y'\nAnd variations of this error.\n```\n\n**Invalid dependency file**\n\n```json\nERROR: Invalid requirement: 'X'\nERROR: Could not open requirements file: 'X'\nnpm ERR! code EJSONPARSE... npm ERR! Failed to parse json\nAnd variations of this error.\n```\n\nIf the application logs contain any of these errors, Auto Restart will not restart the application.\n\n### 6. Application Restart\n\nAUTORESTART automatically restarts your application to bring it back. 😉\n\n<Alert intent=\"info\" title=\"Cooldown Between Restarts\" description=\"Cooldown between restarts is 60 minutes.\" />\n\n## Best Practices\n\nHere are some best practices to make the most of Auto Restart:\n\n- Regularly review your application's logs to understand the reasons for any crashes or restarts. This can help you identify and address underlying issues.\n- Keep your MAIN file and memory allocation parameters up-to-date to ensure optimal performance and resource usage.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAuto Restart in Square Cloud is a valuable feature that enhances the reliability of your application. By automatically handling crashes and unresponsiveness, it helps maintain a seamless user experience. Ensure that you have a plan with Auto Restart enabled and configure it in your `squarecloud.app` or `squarecloud.config` file to make the most of this feature.\n",

Here's an example:\n\n```js\n// The client listens for a 'debug' event\nclient.on('debug', (info) => {\n    // Logs the debug info to the console\n    console.log(`Debug Info: ${info}`);\n});\n\n// The client listens for an 'error' event\nclient.on('error', (error) => {\n    // Logs the error message to the console\n    console.error(`Encountered an Error: ${error.message}`);\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the 'debug' event; it is triggered to provide general debugging information, and the debug messages are logged to the console. Similarly, when the 'error' event is triggered, the error message is logged to the console.\n\n## Debugging in [**discord.py**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/logging.html?highlight=debug)\n\nWith discord.py, you can use the logging module for debugging.
