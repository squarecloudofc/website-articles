#### 📝 Creating the requirements.txt File

To create your requirements.txt file, you need to list all your dependencies inside the file.
Here’s how it would look with the Flask and waitress dependencies.

```txt
flask
waitress
```

Note that by listing this way, the package manager will install the latest version of each package.
If you want a specific version, use double equals followed by the corresponding version number.

```txt
flask==3.1.0
waitress==3.0.2
```

If you use the pip freeze command, it will list not only your dependencies but also their dependencies.
For example, if you have discord-py installed, pip will also list aiohttp, which is a dependency of the
discord-py library. This results in a larger file than necessary and, if used in the global environment, it may
include unnecessary dependencies from other projects.
