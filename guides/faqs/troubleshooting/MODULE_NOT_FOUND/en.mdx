## When does it occur?

This error occurs when your application tries to use a library that is not installed in the environment.

```bash javascript
Error: Cannot find module 'discord.js'
```

```bash python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'discord.py'
```

## Why does it occur?

This can happen when you try to use a library that is not installed by default in the environment. For example, the `discord.js` library is not installed by default in the JavaScript environment.

## How to fix

To fix this, you need to add the missing library to your project's dependency files. These files list the libraries that will be installed in the environment. In the case of Python, this file is called `requirements.txt`, and for JavaScript, it is called `package.json`.

Here is an example of the content of these files after adding the missing libraries:

```json package.json 
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "discord.js": "14.14.1",
    // other dependencies...
  }
}
```

```txt requirements.txt
discord.py
# other dependencies...
```

### Reboot Your Application

After adding the necessary libraries to your project's dependency files, you should reboot your application. This allows your environment to recognize and install the newly added libraries.
