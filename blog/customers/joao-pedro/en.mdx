### **How Promisse Apps reduced deployment time to 10 seconds and scaled to over 1,000 bots with Square Cloud Enterprise**

Promisse Apps offers advanced automation solutions for over 1,000 active clients. To operate on a large scale, the company needed an infrastructure that would eliminate connection bottlenecks and allow for almost instantaneous updates, ensuring stability and high performance for its clients.

<Alert intent="info" title="Before Square Cloud Enterprise, Promisse Apps faced critical scalability and stability limitations in its infrastructure." />

#### The scalability challenge was bigger than Promisse Apps imagined

The growth of Promisse Apps was restricted by a technical obstacle: the limit of connections per IP address in its previous infrastructure. This limitation prevented the simultaneous operation of the growing number of bots, causing instability and delaying the development cycle. The team could not scale at the speed required by the business, which expanded rapidly. The situation was worsened by the need for frequent deployments, which took hours to complete on their previous provider. This not only delayed the delivery of new features but also impacted the end-user experience, who expected quick and reliable responses.

#### The dynamic infrastructure solution from Square Cloud

By migrating to **Square Cloud Enterprise**, Promisse Apps gained a high-performance architecture with thousands of **dynamic and distributed IPs**. This change eliminated the connection bottleneck, providing the necessary foundation for unprecedented growth. The robust infrastructure now supports not only the bots but all of the company's projects, including the corporate website, centralizing operations in a reliable and optimized environment.

They also achieved a drastic reduction in deployment time, which is now just **10 seconds** for over 1,000 simultaneous applications. This means the team can release updates and new features in record time without compromising stability or performance. Thanks to Square Cloud's infrastructure speed, with enterprise NVMe SSDs and a high-capacity network (10Gbit), the average latency for internal requests between applications dropped to less than **30 ms**.

“The main obstacle to the scalability of our bots was the IP limitation. With Square Cloud Enterprise, we overcame this barrier and gained a stable infrastructure that keeps up with our growth. The cost-effectiveness and dedicated support make all the difference.”

> — **João Pedro**, CEO of Promisse Apps
